Hi Ram,

I wanted to provide an update on our progress regarding the UI BDD scenarios and some adjustments we need to make in our resource allocation.

1. As discussed in our bi-weekly call, I reached out to the PO's to gather a list of all possible scenarios that need to be covered in UI BDD. However, they informed me that compiling this list will take some time due to the need for multiple stakeholder approvals. In light of this delay, I had a discussion with UI team to start listing down all the scenarios, both at the page/field level and end-to-end level, so that we can begin working on them to meet our timelines.

2. In our initial discussions, Veera mentioned that the offshore team (myself and Arabinda), along with Black(50% efficiency), would be dedicated to working on the BDD tasks. However, we have encountered a challenge with Arabinda's availability. Gaurav, the PO for Wires 5, has expressed the need to utilize Arabinda's expertise at 100% efficiency for the Wires 5 project. Consequently, Arabinda will be unable to contribute to the BDD tasks as originally planned. Given this constraint, completing crucial BDD scenarios before the July production release might prove challenging.

As Arabinda has strong knowledge of the project, I believe it would be helpful if you can connect with Gaurav to discuss the possibility of aligning him exclusively for BDD work for the next 2-3 sprints.
